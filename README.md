# IFC Website
A website written in Django for WPI's Inter Fraternity Council

### Why go open source?
We believe that a website is crutial tool in communcating to a large audiance,
as such we hope that other IFCs may find this useful as a starting point for their own website
if they don't have one already.

### How do I suggest a feature?
Open an issue and try to describe it as best you can.  Images of what you would like it to look
like are helpful.  Before you submit it, make sure you put the "Feature Request" tag on it.

### How do contribute?
Take a look at the open issues and hack away.  Reference the issue # when you make a pull request.

## Contributer Notes
- We are not going out of our way to support IE, but as a rule of thumb
try to use CSS and JS that works with at least IE 11. [caniuse](https://caniuse.com) is a good resource for this.
